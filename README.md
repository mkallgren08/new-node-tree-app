## About the Application
###### [Back to Top](#factory-node-tree-application)

### Deployed website is [located here](https://new-node-tree-app.herokuapp.com/)

This website allows a user to create new 'Factories' which are nodes that generate a series of sub-nodes containing random numbers within a user-specified range. The Factory data is stored in a database which is read in real-time, allowing multiple users to edit the Factories contained within the overall root node.  

The name of each Factory may be any alpha-numeric combination but must start with a letter. A Factory must have between 1 and 15 nodes; **once created, the number of nodes is fixed**. Each node will contain a random number between a user-defined range of postiive integers.

After creating the Factory, a user may edit the Factory's name and/or the number range for the Factory's nodes. Mutual-exclusion (mutex) protocols have been implemented to prevent multiple users from editing the same Factory by placing a hold and disabling the Editing Panel for that Factory for all users except the one currently performing edits; this helps prevent data corruption.

## Factory Editing
###### [Back to Top](#factory-node-tree-application)

Every Factory has an "Edit This Factory" button. If a hold has been applied to a Factory, a notifiction will appear beneath the Factory's name and the Edit This Factory button will be disabled.
  **-Important Note:** There is currently a documented bug where a user who is editing a Factory attempts to either close, navigate away from, or refresh a page before finishing the edit. Attempting any of these navigation actions will release the hold on that Factory, even if the user cancels the navigation event. **PLEASE NOTE: If you accidentally navigate away from the page while editing, remain on the page _and then close the Editing Panel and immediately reopen it_**. Your data will not be overwritten and reopening the Editing Panel will reapply the hold; preventing other users from simultaneously editing the Factory.

Once a user has clicked the Edit button, an Editing Panel will drop down. This panel contains the following:
  - A field to change the Factory name
  - A field to change the minimum value of the Factory's number-generator
  - A Submit button
  - A Delete button

The user may edit any of the fields available. Please note that the number of nodes is fixed on Factory creation, and that each Factory node is suppossed to be a random number. **At the present time, the application's requirements do not need to allow a user to edit the value of an individual Factory node; they are meant to be random.**

If the user is done editing, they may do one of three things:
  1. Close the Editing Panel: this will release the hold on the Factory but leave any changes made during editing accessible to the current client. If another client edits the Factory, those changes will be overwritten.
  2. Submit the Edits: The application will validate the data and then either perform the edit operations or alert the user of errors. Once validation is successful, the hold on the Factory will be released.
  3. Delete the Factory: The user will be asked to confirm Factory deletion. If the deletion is confirmed, the Factory will be deleted and data used to create the hold on the Factory will be removed

## Test Cases Performed
###### [Back to Top](#factory-node-tree-application)

Below is a list a test cases performed during development:
  1. Create a new Factory
  2. Edit the Factory name
  3. Edit the Factory's minimum range value
  4. Edit the Factory's maximum range value
  5. Edit the Factory's minimum range value _and_ maximum range value
  6. Edit the Factory's name _and_ minimum range value _and_ maximum range value
  7. Delete a Factory
  8. Perform Tests 1-7 while having two clients open to make sure the information is pushed to any open clients
  9. Apply a hold to a Factory being edited to clients other than the client who initiated the edit.
  10. Remove the hold for all clients when the editing client
    - Closes the editing panel
    - Submits edits
    - Deletes a Factory
  11. Check that a hold is applied to a Factory currently being edited on page load
  12. Check that one client can create a _new_ Factory while another client is editing a Factory without affecting either the Factory creation or edit.
  13. Check that one client can edit a Factory while another client creates a _new_ Factory without affecting either the Factory creation or edit.
  14. Check that navigating away from a page will release the holds on any Factories.
  15. Check that refreshing the page of a client who is _not_ editing a Factory with an edit hold applied to it does not remove the editing hold on that Factory

## Known Issues
###### [Back to Top](#factory-node-tree-application)

Below is a list of known issues:
  1. If the range of numbers for a Factory's nodes is small (~ 30 or less ), a node may be generated with a number slightly greater than the specified number maximum. 
  2. The navigation event [issue](#user-who-is-editing-a-factory-attempts-to-either-close) mentioned in the [Factory Editing](#factory-editing) section.

## Future Developments
###### [Back to Top](#factory-node-tree-application)

Below is a list of future developments:
  1. If the need arises, implement the ability for a Factory's individual nodes to be edited.
  2. Replace the alert() and confirm() functions with custom modals - primarily for appearance's sake; the functionality would remain the same.
  3. Test out [mutex](#about-the-application) protocols to handle multiple editing panels open on the same client; if the tests reveal bugs, fix them.
  4. Fix the small range [issue](#known-issues) (Known Issue #1).
  5. Find/build a fix for the navigation event [issue](#factory-editing).
  6. Write automated tests.
